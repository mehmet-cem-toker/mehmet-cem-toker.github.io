A Brief Summary about My Early Carreer

  After getting the Bachelor of Science degree in nuclear engineering in Turkey, I started and completed the M2 master’s degree with a master's thesis in the field of nuclear materials on the effect of hydrogen on the deformation behavior of the material. In this master’s thesis briefly, the mechanical and the deformation behavior of the Zircaloy-4 alloy in terms of the hydrogen concentration was modeled and simulated with the help of empirical correlations computer codes and the results were evaluated. 

  In order to improve knowledge in materials science, radioactive waste management and long-term nuclear safety, as of September 2021 I have completed Nuclear Engineering Masters at Institut national des sciences et techniques nucléaires with the support of EDF company.
  
  Currently I am working in the field of quality inspection of construction activities in nuclear power plant as a nuclear engineer. Professionally, knowing Russian, English and Turkish and French opened many different opportunities to work in nuclear private sector in terms of helping decarbonisation of the world.
