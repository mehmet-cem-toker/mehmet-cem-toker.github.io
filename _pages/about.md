A Brief Summary about My Early Carreer

  After getting the Bachelor of Science degree in nuclear engineering in Turkey, I started and completed the M2 master’s degree with a master's thesis in the field of nuclear materials on the effect of hydrogen on the deformation behavior of the material. In this master’s thesis briefly, the mechanical and the deformation behavior of the Zircaloy-4 alloy in terms of the hydrogen concentration was modeled and simulated with the help of empirical correlations computer codes and the results were evaluated. 

  In order to improve knowledge in materials science, radioactive waste management and long-term nuclear safety, as of September 2020 I have begun the Master 1 Nuclear Engineering program at INSTN - Institut national des sciences et techniques nucléaires with the support of EDF company.  

  Professionally, knowing Russian, English and Turkish opened many different opportunities to work in nuclear energy, in terms of communication skills.
